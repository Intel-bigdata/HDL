# HDL
Support Deep Learning on Hadoop platform, leveraging existing popular Deep Learning engines such as Tensorflow, mxNet, Caffe and Intel Caffe.

This project will focuses on the whole architecture, common facilities and high level considerations. It has respective sub project for each engine, as follows.

* [Tensorflow on YARN](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/TensorFlowOnYARN)
* [mxNet on YARN](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/mxnetOnYARN)
* [Caffe on YARN](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/CaffeOnYARN)
