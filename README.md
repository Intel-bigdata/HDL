# HDL - Deep Learning on Hadoop
Support Deep Learning on Hadoop platform, leveraging existing popular Deep Learning engines such as Tensorflow, mxNet, Caffe and Intel Caffe. Ref. [HADOOP-13944](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-13944)

This project will focuses on the whole architecture, common facilities and high level considerations. It has respective sub project for each engine, as follows.

* [Tensorflow on YARN](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/TensorFlowOnYARN)
* [mxNet on YARN](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/mxnetOnYARN)
* [Caffe on YARN](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/CaffeOnYARN)
